# AURORA ICU — Adult ICU Mission Control (HIS Module)

## Goal
Best-in-class Adult ICU UI + workflow inside a Hospital Information System:
fast decisions, low cognitive load, easy for doctors/nurses, ready to wire to
real APIs and medical devices later. AURORA ICU is the FIRST MODULE of the
broader Aurora HIS platform — see "Platform Direction — Aurora Core +
Modules" below.

## Build Methodology (follow in order, do not skip)
1. UI only, dummy data, HTML/CSS/JS first (already done for screens 1–3 —
   see /reference, treat as the exact visual spec, do not redesign).
2. Convert to a real Vite + React + TypeScript project. Extract shared
   tokens/components once — never re-derive per screen.
3. Review each screen against: UX, ease of use for doctor/nurse, fit with
   real ICU workflow, API-readiness, performance/code organization.
4. Only after a screen is approved, move to the next one in the roadmap.
5. Mock data adapters must be shaped exactly like a future real API response
   (field names, nesting) so swapping in ASP.NET Core endpoints later is a
   data-layer change only, never a UI rewrite.
6. No real API, no auth, no backend until Stage 9 below.

## Screen Roadmap
1. ICU Bed Overview — ✅ approved (`/reference/icu-bed-overview.html`)
2. Patient Mission Control — ✅ built, formal review pending (`/reference/icu-mission-control.html`)
3. Doctor Workspace — ✅ approved (`/reference/icu-doctor-workspace.html`)
4. Nurse Workspace — ✅ built, formal review pending (`/nurse`, first screen built directly in React)
5. Orders & Medication — ✅ built, formal review pending (`/orders/:patientId`, canonical orders model — DW/NW read derived views)
6. Laboratory & Imaging — ✅ built, formal review pending (`/labs/:patientId`, canonical results model — MC lab card + DW results queue read derived views)
7. Timeline — ✅ built, formal review pending (`/timeline/:patientId`, read-only aggregated feed derived from the canonical stores — no store of its own; MC timeline card reads the same feed; minimal ClinicalNote model added for freeform notes). Stage 10 Phase 3: the order/med/lab/imaging events are server-derived; the frontend hybrid-merges the four still-mock sources (see "Stage 10 — API Integration")
8. AI Clinical Assistant — ✅ built, formal review pending (`/ai` unit ranking + `/ai/:patientId`, canonical AI risk model — MC AI panel + alert-center risk alerts read derived views; all predictions simulated until Stage 11). Stage 10 Phase 3 (FINAL domain): ranking + per-patient risk endpoints are real/authenticated, read-only for all roles, trend/delta computed at read (see "Stage 10 — API Integration")
9. Login / Role-Switch screen — ✅ built (`/login`, three-layer RBAC below; real username+password auth added in Stage 10 Phase 2, Stage 9 local session kept as the offline fallback)
10. API Integration (ASP.NET Core Web APIs) — 🔄 in progress: Phase 1
    (roster/patients) + Phase 2 (authentication) + Phase 3 (Labs/Imaging
    results, Orders & Medication, the MAR, the Timeline, then AI — the
    FINAL Phase 3 domain; server-side RBAC on every mutation, read-only
    for the aggregation/AI domains) built; Phase 3 COMPLETE, database
    persistence DONE (Postgres + migrations — writes survive restarts;
    30-day free-DB expiry documented), and Layer 2 ADT DONE in Aurora
    Core (/admissions + /discharges screens live; roster = derived view
    over open encounters) — next is Layer 3 user administration in Core
    — see "Stage 10 — API Integration" below
11. Medical device integration (ventilators, monitors, lab) + AI

## Architecture Rules (binding for all future screens)
See `docs/architecture.md` — production-grade HIS rules: stable PatientID for all
routing/lookups (bed = location only), separated domain models, service-layer
data access, independent reusable components, real-time-ready design, structured
alert/device models. Apply incrementally; don't wholesale-refactor existing code.

## RBAC (Stage 9) — three-layer permission model (PROVISIONAL)
User → Role (JobTitle) → PermissionProfile → Permissions. Roles are NEVER
bound to permissions directly. Profile and permissions are ALWAYS computed
from the JobTitle at read time via lookup (`src/lib/session.ts`) — never
stored redundantly (same rule as clock-computed states). The session stores
ONLY `{ name, jobTitle, token? }` in sessionStorage (survives refresh,
tab-scoped) — `token` is the JWT from Stage 10 Phase 2 authentication;
it adds server-verified identity but permissions are NEVER read from it
client-side. When the auth API is unreachable/unconfigured, login falls
back to the Stage 9 LOCAL session (no token, password not verified,
console-logged). Service-layer adapters re-enforce permissions (defense in
depth); server-side permission enforcement per endpoint is Stage 10
Phase 3+ scope. Finer-grained permissions per profile come in a later
stage — these tables are provisional.

JobTitle → PermissionProfile:
| PermissionProfile    | JobTitles |
|---|---|
| Doctor               | Consultant, Specialist, Senior Resident, Resident, Intern |
| Nurse                | Staff Nurse, Charge Nurse, Head Nurse |
| Pharmacist           | Pharmacist, Clinical Pharmacist |
| RespiratoryTherapist | Respiratory Therapist |
| Ancillary            | Laboratory Technician, Radiology Technician |
| AlliedHealth         | Physiotherapist, Dietitian |
| Administrator        | Hospital Administrator, IT Administrator, Receptionist, Billing Officer, Medical Records Officer |

PermissionProfile → Permissions (and Dashboard landing view):
| Profile | Permissions | Landing |
|---|---|---|
| Doctor               | patients.view, orders.view, orders.create, orders.sign, orders.modify, orders.discontinue, results.view, results.acknowledge, notes.document, ai.view, adt.admit, adt.discharge | /workspace |
| Nurse                | patients.view, orders.view, orders.implement, meds.administer, notes.document, results.view, ai.view, adt.transfer | /nurse |
| Administrator        | admin.view, patients.view | /admin |
| Pharmacist           | patients.view, orders.view, results.view (view-only) | /beds |
| RespiratoryTherapist | patients.view, orders.view, results.view, ai.view (view-only) | /beds |
| Ancillary            | patients.view, orders.view, results.view (view-only) | /beds |
| AlliedHealth         | patients.view, results.view (view-only) | /beds |

Route guards: /workspace = orders.sign · /nurse = meds.administer ·
/admin = admin.view · /beds & /patients & /timeline = patients.view ·
/orders = orders.view (mutating UI additionally needs the prescriber
permissions) · /labs = results.view · /ai = ai.view · /admissions &
/discharges = patients.view (the admit action additionally needs
adt.admit; discharge needs adt.discharge; transfer needs adt.transfer —
profiles never see buttons they cannot use). A session lacking a
route's permission gets an explicit Access Restricted state (never a
silent redirect); no session → /login. The `?as=nurse` dev preview is
retired — the login screen replaces it.

## Canonical Data Domains (mock stores in src/lib/api/data — each maps to a future ASP.NET Core service)
- `roster.ts` — patient identity, location, and bedside state (ONE record per
  patient). Bed board, MC roster/detail, DW rounding list, and NW assignment
  are all derived views; assignments/panels store patient IDs only.
  Orders/results/consults keep denormalized name/bed DISPLAY snapshots by
  design (audit records) but never redefine identity.
- `orders.ts` — orders & medications incl. full audit history + MAR (Screen 5).
  MAR rows are a DERIVED view over the orders' administrations (no store of
  their own) — real since Stage 10 Phase 3 MAR, reading the real Orders data.
- `results.ts` — lab draws + imaging studies incl. acknowledgments (Screen 6)
- `consults.ts` — consult requests, shared by DW and Timeline
- `notes.ts` — ClinicalNote (progress/nursing/procedure/vent): freeform notes
  tied to no structured store action (introduced with Screen 7; 'vent' notes
  stand in until Stage 11 device events)
- `nursing.ts` — nursing tasks + I&O entries (writes go through the service
  layer, never page-local state)
- `ai.ts` — AI risk predictions (Screen 8): per-patient category risks with
  q15min history, factors, advisory suggestions. SIMULATED until Stage 11;
  trend/elevation computed at read time; threshold crossings feed the
  existing alert center (MC Smart Alerts), never a separate alert list.
- Derived-only, never stored: Timeline feed (`timeline.ts`), MAR rows,
  results inbox, MC lab-trend card, rounding/assignment patient views.

## Stage 11 — Interchangeable Clinical Data Sources (locked architecture rule)
Every clinical observation — vitals, ventilator settings/readings,
hemodynamics, infusion pumps, dialysis/CRRT, temperature, urine output —
must eventually support three interchangeable sources: **Manual / Device /
Hybrid**, expressed through ONE Observation model:

```
Observation {
  value, unit,
  source: 'manual' | 'device' | 'hybrid',
  deviceId?,            // set when source involves a device
  capturedAt,           // when the value was measured
  recordedBy,           // who entered/accepted it into the record
  verifiedBy?,          // clinician verification of a device value
  isOverridden,         // a manual override exists
  overrideValue?, overrideReason?,
}
```

Rules:
- Data flows ONE way: Device Adapter → Observation Service → Clinical
  Store → derived views. Devices NEVER write directly to UI state.
- A manual override NEVER destroys the device reading — the original
  device value is always preserved alongside `overrideValue` /
  `overrideReason`, with `isOverridden` flagging the record.
- This supersedes and formalizes the `panels.ts` deferred-debt entry
  below (the identical per-patient vent/hemo/infusion data is exactly
  what the Observation model replaces).
- Implementation is Stage 11 scope, NOT before — do not build the
  Observation model or touch `panels.ts`, vitals, ventilator,
  hemodynamics, or infusion code until then.

## Known Deferred Debt (documented, intentionally not yet unified)
- `panels.ts` attaches the same VENTILATOR/HEMODYNAMICS/INFUSIONS/
  PATIENT_ALERTS/GOALS to every patient — vent/hemo/infusions are now
  formally governed by the "Stage 11 — Interchangeable Clinical Data
  Sources" rule above (Observation model, Manual/Device/Hybrid); alerts
  still await the structured alert model (architecture rule 5). Stage 11
  scope — do not touch before then.
- Infusion channels (`panels.ts` INFUSIONS) overlap active continuous
  medication orders (Screen 5) — post-Stage-11, derive infusions from active
  med orders + pump data arriving as Observations per the Stage 11 rule
  above.
- DW "Notes Due" queue (`workspace.ts` ACTION_QUEUES.notes) is workspace-local —
  should become a state of the ClinicalNote domain (a due note = one not yet
  written) when note authoring gets built.

## Locked Decisions (do not re-litigate without asking)
- RBAC: Doctor = full order/medication authority. Nurse = administer +
  document only, cannot originate orders.
- Orders & Medication / Lab & Imaging / Timeline are standalone routed
  screens, not drill-down panels inside Patient Mission Control.
- Nav: the sidebar "Dashboard" item is role-personalized — it resolves to
  the signed-in profile's landing view (see the RBAC tables above);
  implemented at Stage 9 via the local session.
- Doctor Workspace's quick-order drawer stays lightweight (free text +
  quick-set bundle shortcuts, no drug formulary) — do not expand it. Full
  medication ordering (searchable formulary, dose/route/frequency,
  allergy/interaction checking against the patient's allergy field) is
  Screen 5 (Orders & Medication) scope, built after Nurse Workspace.
- An ID in a URL that doesn't resolve (patient, order, …) must render an
  explicit "not found" state with a route back (see Mission Control's
  Patient Not Found card) — never redirect to or display another record's
  data. Applies to Nurse Workspace and every future screen that resolves
  an ID from a URL.
- Branching: every new screen starts from a fresh branch off the latest
  main with its own PR. Never continue building the next screen on a
  branch that already has an open PR — one screen (or fix-set) per PR.
- Time-relative states (OVERDUE/DUE for tasks, meds, etc.) are computed
  against the current clock at render time — never stored in data.

## Design System (extract into src/styles/tokens.css, reuse everywhere)
Dark medical theme, glassmorphism, background `#060b13`.
Colors: blue `#4da3ff`, cyan `#35e0d0`, green `#3de8a0`, amber `#ffb454`,
red `#ff5d6c`, violet `#a78bfa`. Severity mapping is fixed system-wide:
red = critical, amber = high, green = stable — never reassign.
Fonts: sans `-apple-system,"SF Pro Display","Segoe UI",Inter,Roboto,Arial`;
mono for all clinical/numeric values `"SF Mono","Cascadia Mono","JetBrains Mono",ui-monospace`.
Card radius 18px, `1px solid rgba(130,170,230,.13)` border, blur 14–18px,
shadow `0 12px 34px rgba(0,0,0,.38)`.
Shared components to build once and reuse: Card, Badge/Tag, SeverityDot
(pulses on critical), VitalTile, Sparkline, AlertRow, KpiPill, NavSidebar,
AppHeader, PatientRail, PatientBar, NotFoundCard (the locked not-found
pattern lives in ONE component).

## Stage 10 — API Integration (Phase 1: roster/patients ONLY)
One domain per phase, one phase per PR. Phase 1 replaces ONLY the
roster/patients read path with a real service; Orders, Labs/Results, MAR,
Consults, Notes, Nursing, Timeline, and AI all remain mock adapters until
their own turns in later Stage 10 phases.
- `/server` — ASP.NET Core 8 minimal API, Dockerized (2-stage build).
  One real endpoint: `GET /api/icu/patients` (+ `GET /healthz` probe).
  The wire contract mirrors the mock adapter exactly — `RosterRecordDto`
  in `src/lib/api/types.ts` is the single source of truth for the shape.
  `alertCount` is NOT served: it is derived (AI alerts + unacked results +
  bed alert) from domains that are still mock, so the frontend keeps
  deriving it (derived state is never stored/served — locked rule).
- **SQLite, deliberately** — a documented Phase 1 simplification. Moving
  to SQL Server later is an EF Core provider swap (`UseSqlite` →
  `UseSqlServer` + connection string), not a rewrite. The DB is created
  and seeded at startup from `server/Data/roster-seed.json`, which is
  GENERATED from `src/lib/api/data/roster.ts` — never hand-edit it.
- **Hosting: Render free tier** (`render.yaml` blueprint, Docker runtime,
  rootDir `server`, health check `/healthz`). Free tier spins down when
  idle — cold starts of ~30–60s are expected; the frontend adapter
  handles this with an 8s timeout + silent fallback to the mock roster,
  so the UI never blocks on a sleeping server.
- **Frontend config**: `VITE_API_BASE_URL` env var (see `.env.example`).
  Unset/empty = pure mock mode (safe default). The Pages deploy workflow
  reads it from the `API_BASE_URL` GitHub repo variable. Only
  `getPatients()` in `src/lib/api/index.ts` calls the real API; on any
  fetch failure it falls back to the mock roster (never a broken UI).
- **CORS**: explicit allowlist only — the GitHub Pages origin
  (`https://jaafer272007-design.github.io`) + local dev/preview ports;
  override via `CORS_ORIGINS` (semicolon-separated). GET + POST.

### Phase 2 — authentication (built)
- **Users table** (same SQLite DB): the SAME 20 staff as the Stage 9
  preset list. `server/Data/users-seed.json` is GENERATED from
  `src/lib/session.ts` (`SAMPLE_STAFF` + `usernameOf`, e.g.
  "Dr. Sara Rahman" → `sara.rahman`) — never hand-edit it. Only bcrypt
  hashes are stored (work factor 10, one salt per user), never plaintext.
- **Demo credential — NON-PRODUCTION**: all 20 accounts share the password
  `Aurora2026!` (override via `DEMO_PASSWORD` env). No registration or
  password-reset flow exists yet. This is a documented prototype
  simplification only.
- **`POST /api/auth/login`** (anonymous): username OR full display name +
  password → `{ token, name, jobTitle }`. Any failure returns the SAME
  generic 401 `{"error":"Invalid credentials"}` — never reveals whether
  the username or password was wrong (an unknown user still runs a bcrypt
  verify against a decoy hash so timing doesn't leak either).
- **JWT**: HS256, claims `sub` (username), `name`, `jobTitle`, 12 h expiry
  (one shift). Signing key = `JWT_SECRET` env (render.yaml generates it);
  unset → random per-boot key (tokens just expire on service restart —
  acceptable for the demo, no secret in the repo). Validation middleware
  is registered once; endpoints opt in with `.RequireAuthorization()` —
  currently ONLY `GET /api/icu/patients` (Phase 3 endpoints adopt the
  same line). `/healthz` and login stay anonymous.
- **Frontend**: the login screen is a real username+password form
  (`login()` in `src/lib/api/index.ts`); on success the session stores the
  JWT and adapters attach `Authorization: Bearer` (see `authHeaders()`).
  Profile/permissions are STILL derived from JobTitle — unchanged. If the
  auth API is unreachable/times out (8 s) or `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is unset,
  login falls back to the Stage 9 local session (password NOT verified,
  console-logged) — same resilience pattern as the roster fallback. A
  401 on the roster (stale/tokenless session) falls back to the mock
  roster, console-logged, never a broken UI.
- **Deployed verification**: `.github/workflows/deployed-auth-e2e.yml`
  (manual dispatch) smoke-tests the LIVE Render service — health, login
  JWT, generic 401s, roster 401/200, CORS — run it after any /server
  deploy.

### Phase 3 — Laboratory & Imaging results (built)
First DOMAIN migration after roster, and the first SERVER-SIDE RBAC
enforcement. Orders, MAR, Consults, Notes, Nursing, Timeline, and AI
remain mock until their own phases.
- **Tables** (same SQLite DB): LabDraws + ImagingStudies, seeded at boot
  from `server/Data/labs-seed.json` / `imaging-seed.json` — GENERATED
  from `src/lib/api/data/results.ts` (verified byte-for-byte: zero field
  diffs wire-vs-seed) — never hand-edit them. Result items are a JSON
  column (same pattern as roster's nested objects).
- **Endpoints** (all `.RequireAuthorization()`, wire contract = the mock
  adapter's documented one): `GET /api/icu/results/labs?patientId`,
  `GET /api/icu/results/imaging?patientId`, `GET /api/icu/results/inbox`
  (unit-wide unacked, DERIVED server-side at read time — derived state is
  never stored), `POST /api/icu/results/labs/{id}/acknowledge`,
  `POST /api/icu/results/imaging/{id}/acknowledge`.
- **Server-side RBAC** (`Rbac`, now in `server/Core/Identity/`): mirrors `src/lib/
  session.ts` — JobTitle (from the JWT claim) → PermissionProfile →
  Permissions, computed at read time, never stored/never in the token.
  Acknowledge requires `results.acknowledge`: a NURSE token gets a
  generic 403 even when the UI is bypassed; a doctor token succeeds. The
  acknowledging actor is the TOKEN's name claim — never a request field.
  Replayed acknowledge → 404. Client `hasPermission` checks remain as
  defense in depth.
- **Frontend adapters** (`apiGet`/`apiPost` helpers): reads fall back to
  mock on unreachable/timeout/401 (console-logged) like the roster; the
  acknowledge WRITE distinguishes outcomes — server 403/404 = real denial
  (never applied locally), network failure or tokenless-session 401 =
  offline mode (mock apply, keeping the Stage 9 experience coherent).
- **Known display debts** (documented, deliberate): the MC lab-trend card
  stays a client-side derived view (chart presentation metadata isn't
  served); roster `alertCount`'s unacked-results component still derives
  from the mock store until alert derivation gets its own pass.
- **Deployed verification**: `.github/workflows/deployed-labs-e2e.yml`
  (manual dispatch) — authenticated fetches return seeded data, 401s
  without a token, nurse-403/doctor-200 acknowledge on the LIVE service.

### Phase 3 — Orders & Medication (built)
Second clinical-domain migration; server-side RBAC on EVERY lifecycle
mutation. MAR administrations, Timeline, and AI remain mock until their
own phases.
- **Table** (same SQLite DB): Orders, seeded at boot from
  `server/Data/orders-seed.json` — GENERATED from
  `src/lib/api/data/orders.ts` (verified byte-for-byte: 19 orders, zero
  field diffs wire-vs-seed) — never hand-edit it. Medication /
  administrations / history are JSON columns the mutations rewrite; a Seq
  column preserves the mock's insertion order.
- **Endpoints** (all `.RequireAuthorization()`):
  `GET /api/icu/orders?patientId|status|implement` (per-patient list incl.
  audit history, signature queue, implementation queue — the same derived
  views, repointed at the real store; the NW patientIds narrowing stays a
  client-side derivation), `POST /api/icu/orders` (create; sign=true
  activates + generates the administration schedule server-side; patient
  name/bed resolved from the roster), `POST .../{id}/sign`,
  `PUT .../{id}` (modify; reason required, audit diff computed
  server-side), `POST .../{id}/discontinue` (reason required; scheduled
  administrations cancelled), `POST .../{id}/implement`.
- **Server-side RBAC**: create/sign/modify/discontinue require the doctor
  permissions; implement requires the NURSE's orders.implement (a doctor
  token is correctly 403'd there). A nurse token gets a generic 403 on
  every prescriber mutation even when the UI is bypassed. The
  acting/signing actor is ALWAYS the token's name claim. CORS now allows
  PUT (GET/POST/PUT) — modify's preflight needs it.
- **Request validation — no silent no-ops (patient-safety rule)**: a
  mutation payload that doesn't match the contract is ALWAYS a 400 with
  an `{error}` body, never a 200 that does nothing and never a 500.
  Unrecognized JSON fields fail binding (request DTOs carry
  `JsonUnmappedMemberHandling.Disallow`); create validates every draft
  (known patientId, category/priority whitelists, complete medication
  fields, summary-or-medication) BEFORE inserting any so an invalid
  batch creates zero orders; modify rejects a `changes` object with no
  recognized field instead of recording a "no field change" audit entry.
  Fields the server INTERPRETS must parse: frequency (drives schedule
  generation) is validated against the vocabulary the formulary/order
  sets/seeds use — named values (continuous, daily, bid, tid, qid, once,
  sliding scale, per level, per CRRT protocol) or q<1-48>h — anything
  else is 400, never saved. Display-only free text (dose/route/duration)
  stays bounded free text until Layer 4 makes it formulary-driven.
  This rule applies to every future mutating endpoint.
- **Frontend adapters**: reads + all five mutations swapped with the
  labs write semantics (server 403/404/400 = real denial, never applied
  locally; network failure or tokenless-session 401 = offline mock
  apply). `getMarRows`/`documentAdministration` migrated in the MAR PR
  (below).
- **Deployed verification**: `.github/workflows/deployed-orders-e2e.yml`
  (manual dispatch, idempotent) — 401s, seeded reads, nurse-403 on all
  four prescriber mutations, doctor-200 with token actor, implement
  doctor-403/nurse-200, malformed→400, unparseable frequency→400 on the
  LIVE service.

### Phase 3 — Medication Administration Record (MAR, built)
Third clinical-domain migration; completes Layer 1 for orders + doses.
Timeline and AI remain mock until their own phases.
- **No table of its own — reads the REAL Orders data.** MAR rows DERIVE
  server-side at read time from the signed medication orders'
  administrations (the coupling: administrations live on Orders, now a
  real domain, so the MAR never keeps a parallel copy). Verified the
  server derivation matches the mock `deriveMarRows` byte-for-byte
  (zero field diffs). Adding an optional `reason` to MedAdministration
  keeps orders byte-parity (absent on seeds → absent on the wire).
- **Endpoints** (all `.RequireAuthorization()`): `GET /api/icu/mar`
  (unit-wide derived rows — the nurse-assignment narrowing stays a
  client-side derivation), `POST /api/icu/mar/{orderId}/administrations/
  {adminId}` (document a dose: Given/Held/Refused; mutates the order's
  administration in place + audit history).
- **Server-side RBAC — polarity FLIPS vs the prescriber mutations**:
  administering requires the NURSE's meds.administer, so a DOCTOR token
  gets a generic 403 (mirroring implement); a nurse token succeeds. Both
  roles retain read access. The administering actor is ALWAYS the token's
  name claim. Held/Refused require a reason (validated like discontinue);
  Given needs none. Re-documenting a non-scheduled dose → 404. Malformed
  payloads → 400 (unknown fields fail binding; reason bounded) per the
  request-validation rule.
- **Frontend**: only the MAR adapters swapped
  (`getMarRows`/`documentAdministration`) with the proven read/write
  fallback semantics (server 403/404/400 = real denial never applied
  locally; offline = mock apply). The MAR card's Held/Refused now open a
  required-reason dialog. Timeline and AI adapters untouched.
- **Deployed verification**: `.github/workflows/deployed-mar-e2e.yml`
  (manual dispatch, idempotent) — 401s, seeded reads (both roles),
  doctor-403/nurse-200 administer with token actor, held-without-reason
  400, malformed 400, re-document 404 on the LIVE service.

### Phase 3 — Timeline (built)
Read-only AGGREGATION with NO table — the architectural rule holds
server-side too. `GET /api/icu/timeline?patientId` DERIVES events at read
time from the real domains it can reach; the frontend hybrid-merges the
still-mock sources. AI stays mock.
- **Server derives four categories** from real data, no parallel copy:
  order/med (the Orders audit history — create/sign/modify/discontinue/
  implement AND the MAR administrations, which already live on that
  history), lab (draw resulted + acknowledged), imaging (ordered/
  performed/reported/acknowledged). `TimelineLogic.Derive` ports the mock
  `deriveTimeline` for exactly these — verified byte-for-byte vs the mock
  filtered to these categories (zero field diffs, 4 patients).
- **THE SEAM (explicit, so later migrations don't rewrite the aggregator)**:
  four sources are STILL MOCK this phase — Consults, ClinicalNotes,
  Nursing task completions, I&O entries. The adapter (`getTimeline`) is a
  HYBRID: fetch the real server events, merge with ONLY
  `MOCK_TIMELINE_CATEGORIES = [task, io, consult, note]` from the mock
  derivation, sort into one feed. The two sets are DISJOINT → no event
  appears twice (verified: hybrid merge reconstructs the pure-mock feed
  byte-for-byte, zero duplicate ids). When those domains migrate they
  move server-side and drop out of that list — the merge/sort code does
  not change. MC's timeline card keeps reading the mock derivation until
  `getPatientDetail` migrates (documented drift, like the MC lab card).
- **Read-only for every role** — no mutations, no new RBAC surface;
  behind `.RequireAuthorization()`, both doctor and nurse read, unauth
  401. **Validation**: unknown query params → 400, missing/empty
  patientId → 400, unknown patientId → 400 naming the field (consistent
  with Orders) — never a silent 200.
- **UI preserved exactly**: category filters with live counts, day/shift
  filters, critical-result accenting, deep-links to each event's screen,
  and the Patient Not Found card on unresolved IDs.
- **Deployed verification**: `.github/workflows/deployed-timeline-e2e.yml`
  (manual dispatch, idempotent) — 401, both-role reads (server-only
  categories, seeded events as a subset), malformed-param 400s, and an
  order signed via the real API appearing once as Timeline events
  (derivation, not duplication) on the LIVE service.

### Phase 3 — AI Clinical Assistant (built — FINAL Phase 3 domain)
Completes the Layer 1 transactional migration. Everything is SIMULATED
mock model output until Stage 11 — no real inference is added; the server
just serves the same predictions from SQLite now.
- **Table** (same SQLite DB): AiRisks, one row per patient risk profile,
  seeded at boot from `server/Data/ai-seed.json` — GENERATED from
  `src/lib/api/data/ai.ts` (verified byte-for-byte: 14 profiles / 70 risks,
  zero field diffs wire-vs-mock) — never hand-edit it. Each row stores ONLY
  the per-risk `history[]` + `probability` (as a JSON column) plus scalar
  display fields; a Seq column preserves the mock's profile order.
- **Trend/delta COMPUTED at read, never stored** (locked clock-computed-
  state rule): `AiLogic` ports `riskTrendOf` (delta of last vs first
  history sample: ≥4 rising, ≤−4 falling, else stable), `isElevated`, and
  `deriveRiskRanking` from the mock exactly. The stored rows carry no
  `trend`/`delta` field — the ranking endpoint derives both at read.
- **Endpoints** (both `.RequireAuthorization()`, wire contract = the mock
  adapter's): `GET /api/icu/ai/ranking` (unit-wide, sorted by highest
  current risk; top.trend/top.delta + alsoElevated all derived server-side),
  `GET /api/icu/ai/risks?patientId` (one patient's simulated profile —
  categories, probabilities, q15min history, factors, suggestions).
- **Read-only for EVERY role — no mutations, no new RBAC surface** (like
  Timeline): behind auth, both doctor and nurse read 200, unauth 401.
- **Validation** (codified rule): unknown query params → 400, missing/empty
  patientId → 400, unknown patientId → 400 naming the field; a real patient
  with no AI profile → 200 null (distinct from unresolved) — never a silent
  200, never a 500.
- **Alert Center integration preserved**: risks ≥65% surface as patient
  alerts (≥80% critical) via `deriveRiskAlerts`, still derived from the
  SAME mock store (through `getPatientDetail`, unchanged) — the exact data
  the AI table seeds from, so no parallel copy. MC's AI panel likewise
  derives its single-patient view from that store. Both move to the real
  endpoint when `getPatientDetail` migrates (documented drift, like the MC
  lab-trend and timeline cards).
- **Frontend**: only the AI read adapters swapped (`getRiskRanking`,
  `getRiskProfile`) to the real endpoints with Bearer token + graceful
  mock fallback (the proven read semantics — unreachable/timeout/401 →
  console-logged mock). `getRiskProfiles` (all-profiles) has no server
  endpoint and stays a mock accessor. No mutations exist to migrate.
- **Deployed verification**: `.github/workflows/deployed-ai-e2e.yml`
  (manual dispatch, idempotent — the domain is read-only) — 401, both-role
  ranking + per-patient reads (seeded present, sorted desc, trend/delta
  computed and NOT stored), malformed/unknown-param 400s on the LIVE
  service.

### Database persistence (built) — Postgres + EF Core migrations
The blocking prerequisite for Layer 2 (ADT) is DONE. Writes (signed
orders, acknowledged results, documented doses, …) now SURVIVE restarts
and redeploys on Render.
- **Provider**: `DATABASE_URL` set → PostgreSQL (`UseNpgsql`); the
  render.yaml blueprint defines the `aurora-db` free database and wires
  the connection string into the service env — it exists ONLY in Render's
  environment, never the repo. `DATABASE_URL` unset → the ORIGINAL
  ephemeral SQLite demo mode (rebuild + reseed every boot), retained only
  so a plain local `docker run` still works; the boot log warns LOUDLY.
- **Migrations, generated ONCE in the final namespaces**
  (`Aurora.Core.Persistence.Migrations` — the reason relocation came
  first: the ModelSnapshot embeds namespace-qualified CLR names). Boot =
  `Database.Migrate()` + the existing seed-if-empty blocks (idempotent
  per table). Schema changes are new migrations from here on — never a
  reseed. `EnsureDeleted`/`EnsureCreated` survive only in the SQLite demo
  path.
- **Collation parity (review risk #1, verified)**: SQLite orders strings
  by raw bytes; Postgres by locale. The only DB-side ORDER BYs on string
  columns — `PatientId`, `LabId`, `StudyId` — are pinned to collation
  "C" (byte order) via the project's first fluent config (`AuroraDb.
  OnModelCreating`, Npgsql-guarded); inbox/timeline/AI-ranking sorts are
  in-memory and unaffected. Verified by a full-surface byte diff of
  SQLite-old vs Postgres-new (~100 checks, zero diffs).
- **Persistence-aware ID counters (bug FOUND by the restart test)**: the
  in-memory ORD-/ADM-/Seq counters used to reset every boot — fine when
  the DB reseeded too, but against a durable DB a restart re-issued
  existing ids and a VALID create 500'd on a duplicate key.
  `OrderLogic.InitializeCounters` now resumes each counter from the
  highest persisted id in its generated block (ORD-101+/ADM-501+/
  Seq 1001+ — disjoint from the seed blocks ORD-2001+/ADM-401-4xx/
  Seq 1-999), so fresh-DB behavior is unchanged and restarts are safe.
  ~1,900 generated ids fit before touching the seed block — a documented
  prototype bound, superseded by DB-generated ids at Layer 2.
- **E2E idempotence under persistence**: `deployed-labs-e2e.yml`
  acknowledged a HARDCODED lab (single-shot forever on a durable DB — its
  "idempotence" was an illusion of reseed-on-boot); it now picks an
  unacked lab dynamically each run and fails loudly when the well runs
  dry. The other five suites were audited persistence-safe (run-created
  mutations, subset reads). Suites must be dispatched SEQUENTIALLY, never
  concurrently (relocation-PR lesson).
- **The labs acknowledge leg is SPENT (post-#25 live validation,
  2026-07-09)**: every seeded unacked lab on the durable DB has been
  acknowledged by prior runs, so `deployed-labs-e2e.yml` now stops at its
  designed loud-failure assert ("no unacknowledged labs remain on the
  persistent DB"). This is EXPECTED behavior, not a regression — all
  read-side steps (401s, seeded reads, CORS, imaging) still pass. The
  assert's own advice "extend the seed set" CANNOT fix it: the
  seed-if-empty blocks skip non-empty tables, so new seed entries never
  reach the existing live DB. Accepted as-is for now; do NOT reset the
  live database to revive it (that destroys all durable writes). The
  real fix is a FUTURE PR adding a genuine un-acknowledge or lab-order
  creation capability — note that un-acknowledging a result is a real
  CLINICAL action with audit implications (who reversed it, why, the
  original acknowledgment preserved — same never-destroy principle as
  the Stage 11 override rule), so it must be designed as a feature,
  never bolted onto the test suite.
- **Codified rule — finite seeded resources**: an E2E suite that
  CONSUMES a finite seeded resource is not idempotent against a durable
  database, no matter how careful the picking logic — the well
  eventually runs dry. Future suites must either CREATE the resources
  they consume (MAR/Timeline/Orders create their own orders; ADT admits
  and discharges its own patient) or assert READ-SIDE ONLY (auth, AI).
  Audit of the other six suites (2026-07-09): none consumes a finite
  seed. One related latent exposure, documented and accepted: the
  MAR/Timeline/Orders suites create orders against SEEDED patients
  (P-1001, P-1007) and therefore assume those patients remain ADMITTED —
  since Layer 2, a live ADT discharge of either would 400 the order
  create ("orders require an admitted patient") and break those three
  suites. The full self-sufficiency fix (each suite admits its own
  patient first, like the ADT suite) rides with a future suite touch,
  not now.
- **OPERATIONAL CONSTRAINT — Render free Postgres EXPIRES: 30 days**
  (verified against the Render changelog — the policy changed 2024-05-20
  from the previous 90 days), then a 14-day grace period to upgrade
  before Render DELETES the database and all data (email warnings before
  each). 1 GB fixed; one free DB per workspace. At expiry: Migrate()
  fails at boot, `/healthz` goes down, the frontend falls back to mock
  (never a broken UI). Recovery: upgrade the plan (data kept) or create
  a fresh free DB (real writes LOST; seeds repopulate baseline on next
  boot). Any real use requires a paid database.
- **Verification**: dotnet build clean; full-surface SQLite-vs-Postgres
  byte parity (~100 checks incl. every ordered path, error surface, CORS
  preflight, live create+sign) — zero diffs; the first-ever
  restart-survival assertion (sign + acknowledge → container restart →
  writes intact, zero reseeding, no duplication); restart-collision
  regression (create → restart → create = next id, no 500); all six E2E
  suites run sequentially TWICE against the same persistent DB — 12/12;
  SQLite demo fallback boots with the warning.

### Layer 2 — ADT (built) — the first Aurora Core-native domain
Patient / Encounter / Bed live in `server/Core/Adt/` from day one — never
ICU-shaped first. The first WRITE feature on the durable database, and
the point where the roster seam's identity/location half DISSOLVES.
- **Entities** (AddAdt migration; collation-"C" pins on the ordered/joined
  string keys): `Patient` (table AdtPatients — a person, persists across
  visits: PatientId, MRN, name, age, sex, allergies), `Encounter` (one
  admission: bed, diagnosis, attending, status open|discharged, admitted/
  discharged time+actor, event history JSON), `Bed` (a PLACE: id, area,
  display order — occupancy is DERIVED from open encounters at read time,
  never stored). Seeds: AdtPatients + open Encounters derive at boot from
  the SAME roster-seed.json as the bedside table (P-1001→ENC-1001, no
  drift); Beds from `Data/beds-seed.json` (GENERATED from beds.ts
  BED_LAYOUT — never hand-edit). ADT id counters follow the
  OrderLogic.InitializeCounters persistence rule (resume from persisted
  max — new ids CONTINUE the seed sequence: P-1015+/ENC-1015+).
- **Endpoints** (`/api/icu/adt/*` — the prefix is accepted historical
  cosmetics): `GET beds` (registry + derived occupancy), `GET
  encounters?patientId&status`, `POST admissions` (create Patient if the
  MRN is new, open Encounter, assign a FREE bed), `POST
  encounters/{id}/discharge` (close; bed frees by derivation), `POST
  encounters/{id}/transfer` (move to a FREE bed). All behind JWT auth.
- **RBAC — transfer polarity FLIPS**: admit + discharge are DOCTOR
  authority (adt.admit/adt.discharge → nurse 403); transfer within the
  unit is a NURSING action (adt.transfer → doctor 403, mirroring
  implement/MAR). Actor always from the token's name claim. Permissions
  added to BOTH `Rbac` and `src/lib/session.ts` (provisional tables
  extended, not re-litigated).
- **Validation** (codified rule): unknown fields fail binding → 400;
  occupied bed, duplicate open encounter, nonexistent bed, transfer to
  occupied/same bed, re-discharge → 400 each naming the precise conflict
  (occupant id, encounter id); unknown encounter → 404. Never a silent
  200, never a 500.
- **The roster is now a DERIVED view** (`Modules/Icu/Roster`): open
  Encounters ⋈ Core Patient identity ⋈ the module's bedside snapshot —
  the module reads CORE (correct direction); Core no longer reads the
  roster table anywhere. Admissions appear on the bed board immediately,
  discharges drop off, transfers move beds. A fresh admission has no
  bedside row: a neutral default snapshot is synthesized at read (stable,
  zeroed scores/vitals, all organs ok, an INFO bed note — excluded from
  high-priority alert derivation) until Stage 11 Observations. WHAT
  REMAINS of the old seam: only the bedside columns of the roster table,
  Stage 11 scope; its identity/location columns are dead weight kept for
  schema stability.
- **Seam sites dissolved**: OrderLogic draft validation + order-create
  name/bed resolution, AI ranking's diagnosis join, and timeline/AI
  patientId validation all read Core ADT now. New rule enforced: an
  order for a patient with NO OPEN ENCOUNTER is 400 ("orders require an
  admitted patient"); unknown-patient error text kept byte-identical.
- **Frontend**: the Admissions and Discharges nav placeholders are LIVE
  (`/admissions` admission form with free-bed picker + census;
  `/discharges` open-encounter list with role-gated Discharge/Transfer
  actions + durable discharged history). Route guard patients.view;
  action buttons appear only with the matching adt.* permission. ADT
  WRITES ARE REAL-ONLY — the durable system of record is never applied
  to local mock state (unlike the Stage 9-era offline apply); a rejected
  write surfaces the server's precise {error}. Reads fall back to
  display-only mock derivations offline. `getBeds()` now composes the
  REAL bed registry + REAL roster, so Bed Overview reflects ADT
  immediately (mock fallback offline; getUnitSummary KPIs stay mock —
  documented drift).
- **Deployed verification**: `.github/workflows/deployed-adt-e2e.yml`
  (manual dispatch, SEQUENTIAL with the other suites; idempotent under
  persistence by design — unique MRN per run, dynamic free-bed picks,
  discharges its own encounter). Container-restart durability (admit +
  transfer + discharge + event history survive; counters resume) is
  asserted in local verification where the container can be restarted;
  the live suite asserts the closed encounter remains queryable
  (cross-run accumulation = live durability evidence). The auth E2E's
  exact-14 roster count became a seeded-SUBSET assertion (the census
  legitimately changes under ADT — same lesson class as the labs fix).

## Platform Direction — Aurora Core + Modules (agreed)
AURORA ICU becomes ONE MODULE of a broader Hospital Information System.
Rather than a single large Core-extraction refactor later, the Core grows
INCREMENTALLY: every new layer from now on (ADT, user administration,
master data, printing, …) is built inside Aurora Core from the start —
never ICU-shaped first and extracted afterwards.

Target structure:
- **Aurora Core** — Identity, ADT/Encounter, Master Data, Orders,
  Medication, MAR, Labs, Imaging, Timeline, Observations, Notes,
  Documents, Printing, Notifications, AI framework, API services.
- **Modules/** — ICU (everything built so far) plus future ER, OR, OPD,
  Wards, Oncology, NICU.
- **ICU-exclusive (stays in the ICU module)** — Ventilator, Hemodynamics,
  Intake & Output, ICU flowsheet, ICU daily goals, APACHE II, SOFA,
  sedation workflow, ICU dashboards.

**Open question — RESOLVED as (a) by the architectural review:** Orders,
Medication, MAR, Labs, Imaging, Timeline and AI were relocated to Core in
a dedicated BEHAVIOR-NEUTRAL PR — BEFORE the persistence fix, not after
it. The review corrected the original premise (there was no per-domain EF
config to migrate twice — one convention-based DbContext, zero fluent
config) but upheld the ordering on stronger grounds: (1) migrations
generated by the persistence swap embed namespace-qualified entity names,
so relocating afterwards would invalidate them; (2) the startup seed code
the swap rewrites is the same code the relocation moves; (3) the
reseed-on-boot regime the swap REMOVES was the strongest verification
harness the relocation would ever have (byte-known state + the idempotent
E2E suite); (4) ADT in Core depending on module-resident domains would
invert Core→Module.

**Relocation implementation (done):** same assembly (`AuroraIcu.Api`),
folders + namespaces only — the csproj split into separate Core/module
projects is DEFERRED until a second module exists. Until then the
Core→Module dependency direction is enforced by CONVENTION AND REVIEW
RULE, not the compiler. Structure:
- `server/Core/` — `Identity/` (auth, JWT, RBAC), `Orders/`, `Mar/`,
  `LabImaging/` (results — namespace avoids colliding with ASP.NET's
  `Results` class), `Timeline/`, `Ai/`, `Persistence/` (`AuroraDb` —
  renamed from RosterDb — + `Seeder`), `Shared/` (JsonOpts, ApiError).
- `server/Modules/Icu/Roster/` — the unit roster endpoint + PatientRow.
- `server/Program.cs` — composition root only (builder, CORS, JWT
  registration, seed invocation, endpoint-group Map calls).
Every `/api/icu/*` route string is byte-identical — the URL prefix on
Core domains is accepted historical cosmetics; renaming it would break
the deployed frontend and the E2E suite.

**The roster seam — identity/location half DISSOLVED at Layer 2:** ADT
re-founded Patient/Encounter in Core, and every former Core→roster read
site (order create's name/bed resolution + patientId validation, the AI
ranking's diagnosis join, timeline/AI patientId validation) now reads
Core ADT. The roster endpoint became a DERIVED view — open Encounters ⋈
Core Patient ⋈ the module's bedside snapshot — so the MODULE reads CORE
(the correct direction). WHAT REMAINS in `Modules/Icu/Roster/`: only the
ICU bedside snapshot columns (rhythm, SOFA, EWS, support flags,
bedside/monitor vitals, MAP trend, organs, LOS, code status), read by
the module alone; Stage 11 Observations absorb them and remove the
table. The Seeder still populates the bedside table from
roster-seed.json (the module's own data, not a Core read).

## Post-Phase-3 Roadmap — four-layer data architecture (LOCKED build order)
The remaining build is organized as four data layers. Each layer must sit
on a FULLY-REAL data foundation beneath it — never mix a new write-feature
onto a still-mock store. Per "Platform Direction" above, Layers 2–4 are
built directly in Aurora Core, not in the ICU module.

1. **Layer 1 — Transactional data** (orders, results, medication
   administrations): COMPLETE for Stage 10 Phase 3. Labs/Imaging, Orders,
   the MAR, the Timeline aggregation, and AI (the final domain) are all
   migrated behind the proven JWT + server-side RBAC pattern. The only
   remaining still-mock sources are the Timeline's four hybrid feeds
   (Consults/Notes/Nursing/I&O) — deferred with the ADT/Nursing work, not
   part of Phase 3 — and the alert/MC derived views that ride on
   `getPatientDetail` (documented drift, migrate when it does).
2. **Layer 2 — Entity/ADT data** (patient Admission / Discharge /
   Transfer): DONE — built directly in AURORA CORE (`server/Core/Adt/`;
   see "Layer 2 — ADT (built)" above). The Admissions/Discharges nav
   placeholders are live screens; admission/discharge are doctor
   authority, transfer is a nursing action; the roster is now a derived
   view over open encounters.
3. **Layer 3 — Identity/access** (user administration: create / manage /
   deactivate accounts, password reset): built in AURORA CORE; ties to
   the existing Administrator profile and its `/admin` landing screen;
   supersedes the Phase 2 "no registration/reset flow yet" note.
4. **Layer 4 — Master/reference data** (drug formulary, lab test catalog,
   order sets as maintained DATABASE tables with a manual data-entry UI —
   not hardcoded frontend lists): built in AURORA CORE — the reference
   layer Pharmacy/Lab admins maintain. Orders & Medication then reads
   the formulary from here instead of the current hardcoded 19-drug list
   in `src/lib/api/data/formulary.ts`.

**Database persistence — the BLOCKING prerequisite for Layer 2 (ADT) —
is DONE** (see "Database persistence (built)" above): Render Postgres via
`DATABASE_URL` + EF Core migrations replace the boot-time
`EnsureDeleted`/seed; writes survive restarts/redeploys. Two operational
notes bind: Render's FREE Postgres expires after 30 days (+14-day grace,
then deletion — see the constraint above; real use needs a paid
database), and ADT can now be built on a durable system of record as
required.

Build order (locked, amended by the architectural review): Phase 3
(all five domains), the Core relocation (option (a)), database
persistence (Postgres + migrations), and **Layer 2 ADT (Aurora
Core-native Patient/Encounter/Bed with the roster seam's
identity/location half dissolved)** are DONE. **The next step is Layer 3
(user administration) in Core** → Layer 4 (master data / formulary) in
Core → the deferred Print Center → Stage 11 (device integration + the
Observation model per the locked rule above; Stage 11 also absorbs the
remaining bedside-snapshot half of the roster). The full architectural
review + Core-extraction inventory ran before the relocation and
resolved the domain-relocation open question as (a).

## Accessibility — required on every screen from Screen 3 onward
(Screens 1–2 have known gaps — fix opportunistically when next touched)
- Touch targets ≥ 44×44px
- Visible `:focus-visible` ring on every interactive element
- `aria-label` on all icon-only buttons
- Never convey severity by color alone — pair with icon/text
- Contrast ≥ 4.5:1 body text, ≥ 3:1 large text

## Current Status
Screens 1–8 are built as componentized, routed React pages backed by
canonical mock stores (see Canonical Data Domains); Stage 9 login/RBAC is
in place with real authentication layered on top (Stage 10 Phase 2).
Screens 2, 4–8 await formal review. Stage 10 Phase 1 (roster/patients) and
Phase 2 (auth: bcrypt users table, POST /api/auth/login, JWT middleware on
the roster endpoint, Bearer-token frontend with Stage 9 local-session
fallback) are built on the ASP.NET Core + SQLite + Docker service in
/server, deployable via render.yaml. Phase 3 has migrated Labs/Imaging
results (server-side RBAC on acknowledge) and Orders & Medication
(server-side RBAC on the full lifecycle — create/sign/modify/discontinue
doctor-only, implement nurse-only, actor always from the token) and the
MAR (dose documentation derived from the real Orders data — nurse-only
administer with doctor-403, held/refused reason-validated), the Timeline
(server-derived order/med/lab/imaging events, frontend hybrid-merged with
the four still-mock sources across a documented seam), and AI (the FINAL
domain — read-only ranking + per-patient risk endpoints, both roles read,
trend/delta computed at read never stored, alert-center integration
preserved from the same store). **Stage 10 Phase 3 is now complete.** The
agreed platform direction (see "Platform Direction — Aurora Core +
Modules") makes AURORA ICU one module of the broader Aurora HIS: every
new layer from here is built inside Aurora Core from the start. The
architectural review + Core-extraction inventory has RUN and resolved the
relocation question as (a): the seven real server-side domains (Orders,
Medication, MAR, Labs, Imaging, Timeline, AI) plus Identity/auth now live
under `server/Core/` (same assembly, behavior-neutral — routes/DTOs/wire
shapes byte-identical, verified by full-surface old-vs-new diff + all six
E2E suites); the roster deliberately stays in `server/Modules/Icu/Roster/`
(the roster's identity/location half is now DISSOLVED — see "Platform
Direction"). Database persistence is DONE: Render Postgres via
DATABASE_URL + EF Core migrations; writes survive restarts, collation
parity is pinned and byte-verified, the id counters are
persistence-aware — with the 30-day free-database expiry documented as
the operational constraint. **Layer 2 ADT is DONE, built directly in
Aurora Core**: Patient/Encounter/Bed entities, admit/discharge/transfer
endpoints (doctor-authority admit/discharge, nursing transfer, full
validation with precise conflict errors), live /admissions and
/discharges screens, Bed Overview composed from the real bed registry +
roster, and the roster endpoint re-founded as a derived view over open
encounters. **The next step is Layer 3 (user administration) in Core**,
then master data (Layer 4) in Core, then the Print Center, then Stage 11
device + AI integration per the locked rules above (Stage 11 also
absorbs the roster's remaining bedside-snapshot columns). The Timeline's
four still-mock sources (Consults/Notes/Nursing/I&O) migrate with that
later work, not Phase 3.
